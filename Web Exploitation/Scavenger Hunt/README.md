## Scavenger Hunt

This problem requires you to follow the hints left around the website to find each piece of the flag

#### Part 1 
Located in the html of the website
```html
<!-- Here's the first part of the flag: picoCTF{t -->
```

#### Part 2 
Located in the css of the website
```css
/* CSS makes the page look nice, and yes, it also has part of the flag. Here's part 2: h4ts_4_l0 */
```

#### Part 3 
If you look in the javascript of the website we see the hint "How can I keep Google from indexing my website?". The answer is to make some changes to the **"/robots.txt"** file. When we look inside the "robots.txt" file we find part 3 of the flag 
```python
# Part 3: t_0f_pl4c
```

#### Part 4 
There was also a hint in the "robots.txt" file that said "# I think this is an apache server... can you Access the next flag?". This hint is referring to the **"/.htaccess"** file that are standard in apache servers for managing access to files.
```js
# Part 4: 3s_2_lO0k
```

#### Part 5 
We also see another hint in the "/.htaccess" file stating "# I love making websites on my Mac, I can Store a lot of information there". This hint is referring to the **"/.DS_Store"** file.
```
